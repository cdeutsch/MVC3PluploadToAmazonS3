# ASP.NET MVC3 app that uses plupload to upload directly to Amazon S3  #

This is a working example of using plupload to upload files directly to Amazon S3.

Helper library originated from Cary Abramoff off of this plupload forum thread:
http://www.plupload.com/punbb/search.php?action=show_user_posts&user_id=6207

I've made some changed based on iwasrobbed's excellent Ruby on Rails example:

## Usage ##

Modify the settings in HomeController.cs to use your Amazan credentials and set your S3 bucket.
